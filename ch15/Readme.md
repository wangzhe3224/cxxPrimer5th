# Chapter 15 Object-Oriented Programming

## Exercise 15.1
> What is a virtual member?

A virtual member in the base class will be overided in its derived class.  
When we call a virtual member through a reference or a pointer, the call will be dynamically bound.

## Exercise 15.2
> How does the protected access specifier differ from private?

Member under `protected` keyword can be accessed by its derived class but can not be accessed by other objects.

## Exercise 15.3 | [Code](ex15_01.cpp)

c. illegal. NO derived mark in the declaration.
