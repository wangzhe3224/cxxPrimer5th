# Chapter 04 Expressions

- **What is an expression?**

Expression is composed of one or more *operands* and yields a result when it is evaluated.

- **rvalue** and **lvalue**

An *lvalue* expression yields an object or a function.

Roughly speaking, when we use an object as an rvalue, we use the object's value; when we use an object as a lvalue, we use the object's identity(its location in memory)

In most cases, if we need a rvalue, we can use lvalue equally. But, we cannot do the adverse way.
